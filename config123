sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop
\\ for GUI installation on LTS version UBUntu
enkins provides an Ubuntu repository for the installation packages and we will install Jenkins from this repository.
Add Jenkins key and repository to the system with the command below.
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo 'deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/' | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list

Update the repository and install Jenkins.
apt-get update
apt-get install jenkins

When the installation is done, start Jenkins with this systemctl command.
systemctl start jenkins

Verify that Jenkins is running by checking the default port used by Jenkins (port 8080). I will check it with the netstat command below:
netstat -plntu

Jenkins is based on Java, so we need to install Java OpenJDK version 7 on the server. In this step, we will install Java 7 from a PPA repository which we will add first.

ships without the python-software-properties package for managing PPA repositories, so we must install this package first. Install python-software-properties with apt command.
apt-get install python-software-properties

Next, add Java PPA repository to the server.
add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa
Just Press ENTER

Update the Ubuntu repository and install the Java OpenJDK with apt command.
apt-get update
apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk

Verify the installation by typing the command below:
java -version
